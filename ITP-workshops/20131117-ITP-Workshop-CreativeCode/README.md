**Tools of the trade: Computational techniques every creative coder should know**


Nov 11, 2013 - [Marius Watz](http://mariuswatz.com) | Workshop at ITP NYU<br />
GitHub: [https://github.com/mariuswatz/ITP2013Parametric](https://github.com/mariuswatz/ITP2013Parametric)

Computational concepts for creative code:

- Data: Interpolation, mapping and damping
- lerp() / map() as universal tools for creative coding tasks, especially data-related work, 
generative visuals or time-based behaviors

- Geometry: Vectors, vertex lists, mesh operations
- Motion and time behavior
- Creating 2D shapes by outlining a path
- Bonus: 3D triangulation landscape example (w/ random color palette, per-vertex and per-face shading)

Tools of the trade: Computational techniques every creative coder should know<br/>
Sunday, November 17, 2pm â€“ 6pm

Code is a wonderfully plastic material, allowing the abstraction of parametric behaviors 
and logical processes into executable code. Even the simplest of computational structures 
can prove to be powerful tools, by default defining a potentially infinite series of possible 
outcomes, implied as the sum of chosen algorithms and input parameters.

But not all code is created equal. The needs and interests of artists and designers tend to 
radically diverge from the focus of conventional computer science. Standard algorithms may 
excel at specific tasks, but for the purpose of describing aesthetic ideas the most useful 
tools are often simple concepts that provide a potential for flexible expression. 

This workshop will demonstrate some of the essential computational techniques that every 
coder should know, from deceptively simple geometry hacks to ways to describing kinetic 
motion and time-based behavior. We will look at real-world solutions for reducing code 
complexity and maximizing the expressive potential of parametric  systems. 

Demos will range from basic computational concepts to tried-and-tested workflows for 
professional production. These techniques may not be rocket science, but they represent a 
toolkit for creative coding refined through many years of professional practice.
