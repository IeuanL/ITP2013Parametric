## November 13

**Discovered and fixed:** Nightmare bug in which UFace would calculate arbitray face normals. E(mbarrassing: I sorted the vertex ID array.) All recent builds are likely to contain the bug, so please download the most recent build (any build after Nov 12.)

**Added:** Early (not heavily tested) versions of new classes I think will prove helpful in the future: 

- UGeoGroup: Records UGeo mesh operations like quadstrip and trianglefan to facilitate subsequent manipulation.
- UGeoSelector: Tool to select faces in a UGeo mesh, including faces connected to a given face. Provides tools to draw a preview of the selection and to "grow" the current selection to include adjacent faces.
- UEdgeList / UEdge: Tools to represent the unique edges in a UGeo mesh. All UEdges store a record of faces connected to the edge, making it possible to find the connected faces for any given face.

I have yet to create Processing examples showing this functionality, but curious souls can look in "src-modelbuilderMk2-Test" to see test code.

## November 12

Added ITP-Workshops, which will contain code from workshops I teach at ITP. Code from this weekend's "Sound as Data" workshop can be found there.

I've made several minor and incremental changes to Modelbuilder, I added a few examples showing some of the nicer ones. I now use Ant to build the library, an archive of builds can be found in the "export" folder.


## October 30

Added source folder "src-itp-sketches". It contains miscellaneous code demos and ModelbuilderMk2 tutorials demonstrated in the Parametric Design class at ITP. I've added some examples to the 

## October 20

Plenty of incremental updates and fixes, notably the new UHeading class which supports aligning geometry and vertex lists to heading vectors given by two vertices. That piece of code is based on the [Apache Commons Mathematics Library](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math),
specifically the org.apache.commons.math.geometry package. 

STL import has been added, see UGeoIO.readSTL().


## Sept 28

ModelbuilderMk2: The core functionality of the library is now in place, offering a full replacement for the old Modelbuilder's geometry workflow. The new library design offers many subtle improvements along with some totally new tools. 

Some elements from the old code base (for instance USimpleGUI) are still missing. Given that many functions were added ad hoc and likely only used by myself, I will only re-implement  missing classes that seem important to common uses for the library.

News:

- unlekker.mb2.geo.UNav3D has been re-implemented. If UNav3D is instantiated after UMB.setPApplet() has been called it will automatically register with that PApplet instance to receive events.
- unlekker.mb2.util.UBase (the base class that is extended by most of the core classes) has been renamed to unlekker.mb2.util.UMB for brevity and clarity. (For a second it was called UMbMk2, but that proved too hard to pronounce in class....)
- unlekker.mb2.geo.UTriangulate now offers triangulation of vertex sets that represent 2.5D topologies. It is based on Florian Jenett's code from [http://wiki.processing.org/w/Triangulation](http://wiki.processing.org/w/Triangulation), but it hasn't been extensively tested and appears to have some peculiarities.
- Added UGeo.triangulation(), adds faces produced by triangulation of a UVertexList. As with UTriangulate, this code has not been extensively tested.
- Added UVertexList.point(t), returns an interpolated vertex at position "t" along the vertex list. Ideally this should be done by accounting for actual length of the list, currently the calculation is done using the number of vertices so that t=0.5 of a list with 33 vertices will give an interpolation t=0.5 between the vertices at positions 16 and 17 (t*0.33= position 16 with 0.5 remainder)
- Added UVertexList.resample(n), creates a resampled version of a UVertexList with "n" number of vertices. For now this function uses UVertexList.point(), which is not an ideal solution since it is based only on vertex indices rather than the actual vector length of the list.
- Added UVertexList.copyNoDupl(), returns a copy of the given list with duplicate vertices removed.

## Sept 7

ModelbuilderMk2: Added STL export and file utilities (UFile). The current code works with 2.0 and 1.5.1, but I'm not doing a packaged Processing-ready release just yet. If you're working in Eclipse or similar IDE you can download the code and plug it in.

## Sept 6

Added first version of ModelbuilderMk2, which is a complete rewrite of Modelbuilder. Currently implemented (but incomplete): UVertex, UVertexLists, UGeo - basic features for mesh creation. STL output is not included yet.

## Sept 5

Added ProcessingData library, which is a hack to make the Processing 2.0 Data API available for use in Processing 1.5.1.

## Aug 30 

Posted code for Modelbuilder-0020, which is compatible with Processing 1.5.1. We will eventually migrate to Processing 2.0, but for now 1.5.1 is a more stable platform and many of the Modelbuilder examples have not been updated to be compatible. This build uses ControlP5 0.5.4 by Andreas Schlegel, which can be [downloaded from his repository](https://code.google.com/p/controlp5/downloads/detail?name=controlP5_0.5.4.zip&can=2&q=).

Modelbuilder is in bad need of restructuring. It currently suffers from an abundanc of ad hoc hackery and some poor design decisions, hardly surprising given that is my first serious attempt at writing a comprehensive geometry library. I plan to rewrite it from scratch as part of teaching this class.

As it turns out, Pinterest and Tumblr are excellent sources for inspiration and research, at least in the sense of providing an endless stream of images. Unfortunately, the widespread lack of proper accreditation can make it difficult to trace the origin of works and learn more about the context of their creation.
